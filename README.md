**Krumpets: British English Kotlin API**

#### Description
`Krumpets` offers a set of British English aliases for Java and Kotlin API's

This library is largely a parody of classes used in many common projects, and thus does not comply to the same level of modularisation.  
Please do not make requests for splitting of artifacts or removal of dependencies.  

#### Usage
Import to your project with the following statement:

```android
    compile 'io.ashdavies:krumpets:{latest-version}'
```
